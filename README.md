# 📊 AWS Data Confluence

## 🚀 Project Overview

AWS Data Confluence is a real-time, fully serverless data streaming and analytics platform built using Amazon Web Services. It captures live JSON events from a React web application, processes them using AWS Lambda, stores them in Amazon S3 as a scalable data lake, and enables instant SQL-based analytics using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

Additionally, Amazon SNS is integrated to send real-time notifications and alerts based on incoming data events, making the system suitable for monitoring and operational use cases.
